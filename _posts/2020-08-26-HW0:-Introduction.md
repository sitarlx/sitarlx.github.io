My name is Logan Sitar and I am a senior at the College of Charleston.I am orginally from Connecicut but I moved down to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina going into my sophomore year of highschool. Being from the north, I had an avid love for snowboarding. When I came down to the south, I realized that without snow, there wasn't going to be any snowboarding. That is when I decided to pick up surfing and I have been hooked ever since. It is my way of meditating and getting away from the world for a little bit, especially with everything going on right now. One day I hope to be able to intertwine technology with surfing in some way. I look forward to increasing my knowledge and experience in Software Engineering in order to achieve this goal.

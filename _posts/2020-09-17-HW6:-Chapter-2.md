### 2.1 Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed:
### - A system to control antilock braking in a car: 
The generic software process model that is appropriate for this system is the waterfall model. The main reason is becasue in a system like this, each process needs to be broken into separate parks to ensure each part works efficicently. Another reason would be that the waterfall model incorporates a lot of testing which is absolutely necessary in a system whihc controls antilock braking in a car.
### - A virtual reality system to support software maintenance:
The generic software process model that is appropriate for this system is the 
### - A university accounting system that replaces an existing system:
The generic software process model that is appropriate for this system is the integration and configuration model. This model incorporates reusing old components and systems. The process "focuses on configuring these components for use in a new setting and integrating them into a system."
### - An interactive travel plan:
The generic software process model that is appropriate for this system is the incremental development model becasue an interactive travel plan needs to have different versions with different functionalities like adding more available travel routes and destinations that pop up.

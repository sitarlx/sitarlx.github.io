### Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?
It is impossible to infer te emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components because the properties that emerge "cannot be attributed to any specific part of the system." The emergent properties only come about once all of the parts of the system are integrated together. They are based off a combination of subsystem properties and relationships that define the property. Each property is unique and alter one of the components would alter the emergent propteries, especially in a very complex system. There are 2 types of emergent properties, functional and non-functional. The functional properties only arise after the components are integrated and the purpose of the system is revealed (for example, a bicycle has the functional property of being a transportation device once it has been assembled from its components). The non-functional properties relates to the behavior of the system in its operational environment. This focuses on reliability, performance, safety and security. Reliability, for example, depends on both properties of individual components and their interactions and relationships. The more parts you throw in, the more relationships that part forms which makes it even harder to infer the emergent properties from the peroperties of the system components.

### Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?
The three main types of software mantenance are fault repairs to fix bugs and vulnerablilites, environmental adaptation to adapt the software to new platforms and evironments, and functionality addition to add new features and to supprt new requirements. It can be difficult to distinguish between them sometimes becasue they usually piggy-back on top of each other. Undergoing maitenance of one component most of the times, leads to the maitenance of another. People also give different names for different maitenances so the original, true name can be lost or confused.

### . Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it?
If the software engineer who designed the code is responsible for maitenance on it as well, he is most likely going to want to create code that can be easily maintained. It may not necessarily be their professional responsibility, but it isn't a bad habit to get into. The better the code can be maintained, the easier it is to adapt to new situations.

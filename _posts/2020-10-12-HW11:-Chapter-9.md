### Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?
The three main types of software maintenance are fault repairs to fix bugs and vulnerablilites, environmental adaptation to adapt the software to new platforms and evironments, and functionality addition to add new features and to supprt new requirements. It can be difficult to distinguish between them sometimes becasue they usually piggy-back on top of each other. Undergoing maitenance of one component most of the times, leads to the maitenance of another. People also give different names for different maintenances so the original, true name can be lost or confused.

### Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it?
If the software engineer who designed the code is responsible for maintenance on it as well, he is most likely going to want to create code that can be easily maintained especially. If the employer does not explicitly request it though, it may not necessarily be their professional responsibility. Regardless, it is a great habit to get into that will only help you in the future. The better the code can be maintained, the easier it is to adapt to new situations. This creates a more agile design of the software, welcoming altercations and maintenance.

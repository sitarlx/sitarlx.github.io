### Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests for the wilderness weather station system.
Johny is a computer scientist working for the wilderness weather station. One of his responsibilities is to test the system for reliability and accuracy. To begin, Johny logs on to the system with his designated username and password.

Once logged on, Johny checks the status of the connection to the satellite responsible for his section of wilderness and makes sure the connection is secure and the data is up to date. If everything is up to date then he requests a summary of the data in order to use the data for tests.  If everything is not up to date then he must make a call to the satellite stating where the error occured. The satellite fixes the error if able to and the new data is updated and sent to Johny.

###  A common approach to system testing is to test the more important functionalities of a system first, followed by the less important functionalities until the testing budget is exhausted. Discuss the ethics involved in identifying what “more important” means.
What may be "more important" to one person may not be to another. This can be an ethical problem becasue your boss might think one part of the code is more important when in fact its not and if you exhaust all your budget then you cannot go back to fix other problems. This is not ethical for a customer either because they are going to get a product that is not 100% bug free. This is why you need to spend the most time testing (about half of the entire time) in order to fix all bugs. Nothing is software is more or less important than the other. Everything is intertwined together and if one thing is faulty, it will most likely end up with system failure or a defective product.

### Relection on Testing
After reading the article on testing, I realize just how important it is but how much we really despise it. Humans don't like being wrong, especially in front of other people. What testing and debugging does is show people simply how poor their code is. If everyone could program perfectly, there would be no need for testing. No one is perfect as well all know and human error does infact occur. People don't want to test their work becasue of the associated guilt that comes with finding bugs. Personally, finding bugs is pleasurable becasue it helps me know what I did wrong and I am able to correct it and prepare for the next time it happens. Just like anything else, you need to fail before you succeed and testing is a necessary failure before your software succeeds. If you try to resist this failure, your software will not succeed in the long run.

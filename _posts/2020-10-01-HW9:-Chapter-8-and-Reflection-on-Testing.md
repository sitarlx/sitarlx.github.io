### Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests for the wilderness weather station system.
Johny is a computer scientist working for the wilderness weather station. One of his responsibilities is to test the system for reliability and accuracy. To begin, Johny logs on to the system with his designated username and password.

Once logged on, Johny checks the status of the connection to the satellite responsible for his section of wilderness and makes sure the connection is secure and the data is up to date. If everything is up to date then he requests a summary of the data in order to use the data for tests.  If everything is not up to date then he must make a call to the satellite stating where the error occured. The satellite fixes the error if able to and the new data is updated and sent to Johny.

###  A common approach to system testing is to test the more important functionalities of a system first, followed by the less important functionalities until the testing budget is exhausted. Discuss the ethics involved in identifying what “more important” means.

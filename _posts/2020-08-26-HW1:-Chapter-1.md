### Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or lawyers.
	-I believe professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as professional doctors or lawyers are. Similarly to trusting your health or even your life with a doctor or your legal or not so legal life with a lawyer, you trust your persoanl life with your software engineer. Everything pertaining to your life is managed and stored with software and all this stored data can be easily stolen or manipulated for others use. You want the best qualified software engineers to handle and secure all that important data just like you want the best qualified doctor or lawyer to ensure that your life is in good hands. If your personal data is not placed in the right hands, then your life can quickly turn upside down.

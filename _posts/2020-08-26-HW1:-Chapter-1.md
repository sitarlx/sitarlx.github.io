### 1.3: 
### What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four other attributes that may be significant. 
The four most important attributes that all professional software should possess are maintainability, efficiency, security, and dependanility.
Four other attributes that may be significant in professional software are readability, fluidity, universality with devices, and whether or not it can be scaled for larger or smaller problems. 
### 1.8: 
### Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or lawyers.
I believe professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as professional doctors or lawyers are. Similarly to trusting your health with a doctor, you trust your legal life with a lawyer and you trust your personal life with a software engineer. Everything pertaining to your life is managed and stored with software and all this stored data can be easily stolen or manipulated for others use. You want the best qualified software engineers to handle and secure all that important data just like you want the best qualified doctor or lawyer to ensure that your life is in good hands. If your personal data is not placed in the right hands, then your life can quickly turn upside down.

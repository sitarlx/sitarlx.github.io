### Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of errors are unlikely to be discovered through inspections?

Program incspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program because they often find problems withs tests and so improve their effectiveness in detecting program bugs. In the process of program inspections, team members collaborate with each other to carefully review the program source code line by line. Any of the defects they coud find could be logical errors, anomalies in the code that might indicate an erroneous condition or features that have been omitted from the code. Organizations need to create their own inspection checklists based on their local standards and practices. As new types of defects are found, the checklist is updated as needed. Companies have found this to be a good method becasue it helps detect around 60% of defects. These inspections can be very costly though so many companies chose not to use them. The types of errors that are unlikely to be discovered through inspections are errors regarding a specific language or domain. The inspection would be unlikely to discover errors that may have never been encountered before too.

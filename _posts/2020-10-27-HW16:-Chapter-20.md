### You work for a software company that has developed a system that provides information about consumers and that is used within a SoS by a number of other retail businesses. They pay you for the services used. Discuss the ethics of changing the system interfaces without notice to coerce users into paying higher charges. Consider this question from the point of view of the companyâ€™s employees, customers, and shareholders.
Employee POV: As an employee, if you are the one altering the interface without notice of the companies future intentions, you should not be held accountable for any ethical issues. You were doing your job and what you were told to do.

Customer POV: As a customer, you don't truly know what goes into modification and updating of a system. It could be an extrenuous process that could wind up with many bugs. With that being said though, if a company plans to charge more for an updated product then that should be specifically defined and customers who already possess the system or service should not have to pay for it.

Shareholders POV: As a shareholder, an increase in price potentially means an increase in company value. Even if they were specificaly told about the higher charges, I am sure they would not be concerned with making more money. However if legality issues could arise from altering a systems interface, they would want to know these issues before hand.

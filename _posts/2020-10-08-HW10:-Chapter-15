### 15.10: 
### The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intelectual property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code?
At the end of the day, the customer paid for the code so he owns it and has the right to reuse the code. Altough the software contractor actually developed the code, he was paid to develop it and did notr develop it on his own. Similarly to building a house or building, the contractors who actually designed and built the building do not own that building. The customer who paid them, like the customer who paid the software contractor, owns the building and can reuse it however he likes (airbnb, rent, sell, etc.). 
### Does the software contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component?
The contractor does not have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component. However, he can ask or pay the owner for rights of the code.
### What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components?
Providers can be reimbursed in a variety of ways. They can obtain royalties for duration of use, simply sell the software, or be provided stock in future business and software that uses their code.
### Dicuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.
The reusing of code does not always have to be unlawful. Why reinvent the wheel? I think reusable code should not be used if it is to preform the same overall goal as the previous software. If it is being tweaked and modified, similarlty to patents the that is okay. If you want/need to use the code verbatum, compensations should be given to the owner of the code.
